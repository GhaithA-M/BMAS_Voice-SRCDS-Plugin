# BMAS-SM-Plugin

This is a plugin for Sourcemod 1.11 or higher. It is made for CS:GO, but may work in other Source titles.
This plays a sound Black Mesa Annoucement System vox when a certain amount of time is remaining in the round.
Each word is a seperate *.wav file., meaning:

In order to say "20 seconds remaining" you'll have to write:

"twenty.wav", "seconds.wav", "remaining.wav"

In your cfg/sourcemod/bmas_voice.cfg
